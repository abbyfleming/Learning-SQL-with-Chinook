## Downloading the Database Files

Click the big download button from the [Chinook Database](http://chinookdatabase.codeplex.com/) site. Know which directory that it's being downloaded to.

That file **is** the database. It contains all of the tables and data. You can now open up that file in the SQLite Browser application to see it.

## Instructions
